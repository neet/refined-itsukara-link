    <Typography.Paragraph>
      A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He
      can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a
      man, if you devote yourself to an ideal and if they canâ€™t stop you then
      you become something else entirely. Legend, Mr Wayne.
